1) Ace     4 points
   King    3 points
   Queen   2 points
   Jack    1 point

2) -1 point for any king of a suit which the hand
    hold no other cards
3) -1 for any queen in a suit which the hand holds only
    zero or one other cards
4) -1 for any jack in a suit in which the hand only hold
    zero or one or two other cards

5) +1 for each suit which the hand contains 2 cards
6) +2 for each suit in which the hand contains 1 card
7) +2 for each suit which the hand contains 0 cards

Suit is stopped if
    it contains an ace
    it contains a king and at least 1 other card
    it contains a queen and at least 3 other cards

The 3 most common possibilies during opening assesment is
1) the hand evaluates to < 14 point - pass
2) the hand evalatates to >= 14 points. Bidding opened in one of the 
    suits with the most cards
3) open bidding in "no trump" if hand evaluates to >= 16 points
    ignoring rules 5, 6, and 7 and all 4 suites are stopped. A no
    trump bid is always preferred over a suit bid when both possible

6 points for 2 kings
4 points for an ace
6 points for 3 queens
1 for a jack
17 points + 1 for having only 2 spades - 1 for having a queen of spades
with only one other spade = 17 points (i.e. opening bid)
For no trump, it is 16 points since we cannout count the 1 point for 
having only 2 spades, but cannot open no-trump since hearts are not stopped
Since there are 4 clubs and 4 diamonds BID C or BID D (sort order S H D C)
